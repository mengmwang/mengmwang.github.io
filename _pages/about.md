Welcome to my page! 

My name is Mengmeng Wang (Chinese as 王萌萌). I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Orygen and Centre for Youth Mental Health at the University of Melbourne. 

As part of my daily work, 
- I conduct data cleaning, statistical modelling, analysis and visualisation using Python and R programming languages;
- I work with different types of data such as survey data and administrative healthcare records;
- I develop/apply machine learning and natural language processing methods for health outcome prediction. 

I received my PhD degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Melbourne, working on statistical signal processing methods used in functional near-infrared spectroscopy.

Previously, I have experience in neuroimaging and signal processing, image processing, telecommunications engineering and various projects across electrical engineering, biomedical engineering and computer science.

I’m passionate about data science and machine learning applications. I enjoy solving challenging problems in statistical data modelling, big data analytics and machine learning.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
